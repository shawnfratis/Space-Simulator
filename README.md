# Space-Simulator
These are the beginning components of what will eventually be a space simulator game.

The entire package of libraries, etc. I'm using are HERE:
http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/

I'm having to use version 2.1 instead of 3.3 because 3.3 won't work with an Intel.

You will need uvmap.DDS. You can make one, use the one in the library, or just let me know and I'll send you mine.

The .OBJ file is still named suzanne.obj (Blender monkey), but it is actually a sphere. If this one doesn't work, let me know and I'll send you mine.

If you use the tutorial library, you can probably just overwrite the .cpp and .obj files with these and it should work.
If not let me know. The original work file is called tutorial08_basic_shading.
